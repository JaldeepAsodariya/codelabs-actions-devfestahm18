# Codelabs: Actions on Google

These samples serve as the completed source code for
[Actions on Google codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Assistant).
The `level1-complete` directory should be used as a reference for the
Level 1 codelab, and as a starting point for the Level 2 codelab. The
`level2-complete` directory can be used as a reference for the Level 2 codelab.

## Setup Instructions

For detailed instructions on using this code, refer to the
[Actions on Google codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Assistant),
Level 1 and 2. Below are steps to deploy the code for any directory
(i.e. `level1-complete`, `level2-complete`).

### Steps

1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
1. Click *Skip*, located on the top right to skip over category selection menu.
1. On the left navigation menu under *BUILD*, click on *Actions*. Click on *Add Your First Action* and choose your app's language(s).
1. Select *Custom intent*, click *BUILD*. This will open a Dialogflow console. Click *CREATE*.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `codelabs-actions-level-<one/two>.zip` file in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the `functions` folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
    1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply `N` when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
    1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL : https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowWebhook`.  If the Function URL doesn't show, you can always check at the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.
1. Select *Integrations* from the left navigation menu and open the *Integration Settings* menu for Actions on Google.
1. Enable *Auto-preview changes* and Click *Test*. This will open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
